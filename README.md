## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a showcase of my skills as a Full Stack Developer, built from the ground up to demonstrate my passion for creating clean, interactive, and visually appealing web experiences.

This isn't just a list of my projects; it's a project in itself, featuring a modern design, dynamic animations, and a fully responsive layout.

## ‚ú® Features

This portfolio is built with a focus on user experience and modern web technologies.

-   **Interactive & Animated UI:** The entire interface is brought to life with a traveling neon beam background animation and subtle hover effects that make for an engaging user experience.
-   **Light & Dark Mode:** A seamless theme toggle allows users to switch between a slick, neon-infused dark mode and a clean, professional light mode.
-   **Fully Responsive:** The design is mobile-first and adapts perfectly to all screen sizes, from a small phone to a large desktop monitor.
-   **Glassmorphism Design:** Project cards use the "glassmorphism" effect for a modern, semi-transparent look.
-   **Structured Content:** Includes dedicated sections for my projects, a categorized list of my technical skills, and contact information.

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html    // The main (and only) HTML file
